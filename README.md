# CineForge 🎬
**Unleash the Power of Cinematic Pro-Grade Video Editing**

CineForge is a professional-grade, high-performance video editing engine for Android, designed to provide a buttery-smooth editing experience with multi-touch gestures and a reactive timeline.

## 💡 The "Why" behind CineForge
I built this because I was tired of being paywalled. Like many creators, I used countless editing apps, only to be constantly interrupted by "Premium Plan" requirements for basic cinematic effects and features. Fed up with the irritation of subscription-locked creativity, I decided to work on my own cinematic editing experience. This is built for the love of the craft, not the subscription.

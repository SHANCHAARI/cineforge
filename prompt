I am building a production-ready, real-data-based web application for a National Level Hackathon under the theme:

“Innovation for Rural Empowerment & Sustainable Technology”

Domain: Finance
Problem Statement: Agricultural Income & Crop Insurance Assistant

Project Name: AgriShield AI

I want to build a fully functional, mobile-first Progressive Web App (PWA) designed specifically for Indian farmers.

The application must:

Be smooth and lightweight

Load fast even on low-end Android phones

Use real APIs and real datasets (no fake or hardcoded data)

Be farmer-friendly with simple UI

Support multiple Indian languages

Use explainable and transparent prediction logic

CORE FUNCTIONAL MODULES

Crop Income Forecast Engine

Input: Crop type, land area, location

Use real historical yield data

Use weather forecast data

Calculate predicted yield

Multiply with real mandi price

Show expected income

Show risk-adjusted income

Weather Risk Scoring

Use real weather API

Calculate drought risk

Calculate flood probability

Output simple risk score (0–10)

Smart PMFBY Insurance Assistant

Implement PMFBY compensation formula

Estimate payout using yield deviation

Show claim probability logic

Explain calculation clearly

Mandi Price Optimization

Use real Agmarknet or mandi data

Show 7-day trend

Simple “Sell Now” or “Wait” indicator

Farmer Financial Health Score

Score based on yield stability

Risk exposure

Income consistency

Display simple rating: Good / Medium / Risky

UI REQUIREMENTS

Mobile-first responsive design

Large buttons

High contrast colors

Minimal text

Icon-based navigation

Circular risk meters

Card-based layout

Multi-language dropdown

Optional voice output using Web Speech API

No complex animations.
No heavy UI libraries.
Keep it fast and clean.

TECH STACK (Google Ecosystem Preferred)

Frontend:
React + Vite + Tailwind CSS

Backend:
FastAPI (Python)

Database:
Firestore or PostgreSQL

Hosting:
Google Cloud

AI:
Scikit-learn or lightweight ML models
Explainable algorithms preferred

Weather:
OpenWeather API

Maps:
Google Maps API

Ensure:

Async API handling

Caching mechanism

Error handling

Clean architecture separation

Modular structure

Production-grade folder structure

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS

First load under 2 seconds

Optimized bundle size

Lazy loading

API response under 300ms

Mobile 3G optimization

No blocking scripts

OUTPUT I NEED

Provide:

Complete folder structure

Frontend code structure

Backend API structure

ML model explanation

Database schema

Risk scoring formula

Deployment steps

PWA setup instructions

Security best practices

Scaling strategy

Clean comments in code

This must be production-quality, not demo-only.

Think like a senior software architect building a scalable agri-fintech platform.
